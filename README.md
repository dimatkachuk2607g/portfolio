# Dima Tkachuk — Python QA & Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I am a **Junior QA Tester** specializing in **Python testing and automation**.  

In this portfolio, there are **7 hands-on projects** located inside the `projects` folder:  
- **Core projects:** `Python`, `OOP Python`, `Selenium`, `Playwright`, `API Testing` —  
  focused on **Python (basic and advanced), Pytest automation, API testing, and automation frameworks**,  
  also including **basic GitHub Actions integration** for running tests and generating reports.  
- **Side projects:** `Website for Automation`, `Data Analysis` — covering web fundamentals and data analysis with Python.

Additionally, the `projects` folder contains a README explaining how to install all requirements at once.
