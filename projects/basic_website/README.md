# Basic Automation Website Project

This project is a basic website for QA automation testing in my selenium/playwright projects.

It includes three HTML pages with links, a form with different inputs and an iframe.


## Running the Project

To run the website navigate to **projects/basic_website/src** in your file explorer,
open the homepage file `index.html` in your browser which contains direct
links to the form and iframe pages.
