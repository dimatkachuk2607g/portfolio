# Projects Folder

This folder contains all **7 hands-on projects** included in my Python QA & Automation portfolio.  
Each project has its own structure, tests, and documentation.

## Quick Setup

To install all requirements for every project at once, from this **projects** folder run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Playwright also run:
```bash
playwright install
```

**Browser Note:**  
Tests run with Chrome/Chromium by default and should work as is,
If not, install Chrome manually. drivers are managed automatically by Selenium and Playwright
in the newer versions.
